**Who am I?**

Hey there 👋 If you’re new here, my name’s Jeming!

I’m currently a student at UNSW Sydney, studying a Bachelor’s of Commerce and a 
Bachelor’s of Computer Science.

I’ve completed a bunch of internships and placements related to both fields/areas of my degree.
Technology, Software Engineering, Startups, Consulting, and Finance are some of my interests
right now in the professional space!

In my spare time, I love going to the gym, playing chess, cooking, playing basketball and 
tennis, and video games! I also love snacking - my go to snack combo right now is corn chips 
with cream cheese as a dip - I’m trying to eat healthier snacks now :(

**What is this?**

Here, on my github, I store and (occasionally) share any personal projects and learnings that 
I have worked on in the past, or currently working on right now. I'm an avid learner and am
always curious about new technologies and trends that are popping up. Particularly, I'm interested
in cloud computing, and have already completed a few AWS Certifications!
