Hey there 👋 If you’re new here, my name’s Jeming!

I’m currently a student at UNSW Sydney, studying a Bachelor’s of Commerce and a 
Bachelor’s of Computer Science.

I’ve completed a bunch of internships and placements related to both fields/areas of my degree.
Technology, Software Engineering, Startups, Consulting, and Finance are some of my interests
right now in the professional space!

In my spare time, I love going to the gym, playing chess, cooking, playing basketball and 
tennis, and video games! I also love snacking - my go to snack combo right now is corn chips 
with cream cheese as a dip - I’m trying to eat healthier snacks now :(
